    <textOnly>Hello Dr. {!Lead.DV_Signer_First_Name__c} {!Lead.DV_Signer_Last_Name__c},

After reviewing the information that was submitted for {!Lead.FirstName}’s evaluation of wish eligibility, we have concluded that your patient does not meet our medical eligibility criteria for a wish at this time. If you would like to review our criteria please visit us online at www.md.wish.org.

If you feel there is additional information you could provide that would be supportive of wish eligibility, please contact us.

If in the future, should the child’s medical condition change, we encourage you to refer the child again using the online referral form on www.md.wish.org.

Thanks to the support of you and other medical professionals around the country, we continue to come closer each year to our vision of making every eligible child’s wish come true.

Regards,
{!Lead.OwnerFullName}

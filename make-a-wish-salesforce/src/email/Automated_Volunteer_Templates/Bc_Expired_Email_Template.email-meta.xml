    <textOnly>Hi {!Background_check__c.Volunteer__c},

Thank you so much for your dedication to Make-A-Wish®. Our records indicate that your criminal background check has expired. If you are still interested in volunteering with Make-A-Wish, please log in to the Make-A-Wish Volunteer Center to initiate your background check. If the required information has not been completed by {!Background_check__c.Date__c + 7}, we will mark you as “INACTIVE” and any current assignments will be re-assigned to an active volunteer.

We are grateful for your continued support of our mission and the children we serve!

Thanks,

{!Background_check__c.Account_Name__c}

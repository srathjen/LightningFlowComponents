Thank you for recently attending our volunteer orientation. We are excited to have you join the Make-A-Wish family!

The next step in the process is to have you select the volunteer role(s) that interest you. At your convenience, please log in to the Make-A-Wish Volunteer Center at https://make-a-wish.force.com/communitieslogin and click &quot;Continue Process&quot; to do so. After selecting your roles you will have the opportunity to read and electronically sign our Conflict of Interest &amp; Ethics Statement.

Should you have any questions regarding this part of the volunteer process, please contact us directly.

Best wishes,

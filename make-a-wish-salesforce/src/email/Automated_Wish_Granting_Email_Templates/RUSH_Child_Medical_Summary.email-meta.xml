Your patient has chosen a wish!


We are considering this wish a RUSH and need to expedite the process. Please review and complete the questions on the attached Child Medical Summary Form and detail any medical information that might be needed to make the wish safe for your patient.


Thanks to the support of you and other medical professionals around the country, we continue to come closer each year to our vision of making every eligible child’s wish come true.  Thank you for taking the time to help us share the power of a wish®.


Thank You,


Make-A-Wish®</textOnly>
